# Big Eyes

### Description
This JavaScript code creates an interactive effect on a webpage displaying two big eyes with pupils that follow the position of the mouse cursor. The code sets an event listener for the "mousemove" event, calculates the cursor position relative to the window size, and applies the position to the pupils' CSS styles. Which then creates the illusion of the pupils following the mouse movement.
### How to Run
After downloading the code and loading the index.html you will be able to interact with the webpage as described. 

### Roadmap of Future Improvements
I would like to create a way where the color of the pupils or background change according to how close the mouse is to the eyes. Another Future improvement would be to add some easter eggs in the code Ex. Clicking on the “eye” then having it turn red.
